        <p class="font-text text-lg">
            Formed recently in 2018 in the town of Mansfield, Nottinghamshire, Rock'n'Rollin Bike Club is a cycling club
            with great enthusiasm for every part of cycling; from road to downhill cycling. We started out as a small
            band of friends looking for adventure and fitness, meeting here and there around the East Midlands, and
            quickly made friends in all areas of cycling, pushing each other's limits in a race to find thrills.
            <br><br>
            We strive to be the benchmark that other clubs want to emulate! After 3 years, the energy for cycling in the
            club has continued to excel and our ethos of the club is simple - to be a home for similar individuals, who
            want to ride their bikes and have a laugh while doing it.
            <br><br>
            As a still highly active cycling club, we have lots to offer for any newcomer willing to take on the cycling
            world. We have some of the most excellent routes in our area and use applications such as Strava, AllTrails
            and Komoot to helps us guide anyone in the right direction they want to take with their cycling.
            <br><br>
            We are not all about the newcomers, some of the experienced riders like to challenge themselves mentally and
            physically. If you are setting up for a big event and you need the determination and schedule. We could
            provide that with scheduled fast-paced club rides.
            <br><br>
            If any of the above is what you are looking for in a club, you are not disappointed there is enough
            experience and members in our club to cater for everyone newbie to racer.
